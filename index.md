# About 

---

I am a Graduate student here at Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing my Master's in Bioinformatics. 
<br>
Currently I am interning as a Bioinformatics Co-op at the preclinical lab at GSK Vaccines, Maryland. Here I am working with ScRNA-seq and RNA-seq data while also applying my data science skills.
<br>
Previously, I was working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="http://www.storicilab.gatech.edu/">Storici Lab</a>.My Project at the Storici Lab revolves around the DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I was using different machine learning techniques to predict the firing time of the autonomously replicating sites (ARS) in it's DNA, based on the incorporation of Ribonucleotides. 
<br>
I pursued my Undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering at Mumbai University from the years 2015 to 2019 with a CGPA of 7.79/10.
