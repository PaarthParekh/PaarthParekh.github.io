# About 

---

I am a Graduate student here at Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing my Master's in Bioinformatics. Currently I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="http://www.storicilab.gatech.edu/">Storici Lab</a>
<br>
My Project revolves around the DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I am using different machine learning techniques to predict the firing time of the autonomously replicating sites (ARS) in it's DNA, based on the incorporation of Ribonucleotides.
